# RM 5.1 Wire Format Notes

Internal reference for the RM 5.1 helpers in the `McpNativeRulesLib` library plus the shared classic-dynamicPage wizard primitives in `hubitat-mcp-server.groovy`.
Moved from in-source Groovydocs to avoid multi-paragraph docblock sprawl.

## _rmAddAction

High-level orchestrated action creation. Replaces the 6-7 manual wizard calls
(init selectActions → click N with stateAttribute=doActN → set actType → set
actSubType → set type-specific fields → wait for actionDone → click actionDone).

### Wire-format quirks (firmware 2.5.0.123, verified live via Chrome DevTools + curl)

1. **stateAttribute=doActN** — the "Create New Action" button (name=N) requires
   the literal concatenation of "doAct" and the button name "N". Sending
   `stateAttribute=doAct` alone sets `state.doAct='N'` but NOT `state.doActN`,
   and doActPage then errors with "Cannot invoke method startsWith() on null object".

2. **Incremental schema** — doActPage's schema is incremental: `actionDone` only
   appears AFTER all required type-specific fields are set. `_rmWriteSettingOnPage`
   re-fetches the schema before each write, so calling it for every field
   guarantees `actionDone` is present by the final click.

3. **state.actNdx initialization** — selectActions' page hook initializes
   `state.actNdx`. On a freshly created rule with zero actions, `state.actNdx`
   is null and doActPage renders with `actType.null` (broken). Fire an empty
   POST to selectActions FIRST to initialize actNdx -- `_rmInitSelectActionsPage`
   handles this idempotently.

4. **Navigation bake** — the helper navigates `doActPage→selectActions` at the
   end so the action is fully baked into `actions[]` and `state.actNdx` is
   advanced before the next `addAction` can land. The navigation marker drives
   the action bake; firing `updateRule` per-action is not needed (and would add
   latency in batch scenarios).

### Capability families and spec fields

Use `addAction({discover: true})` to get the live schema from the code. Key
families: `switch`, `dimmer`, `color`, `colorTemp`, `lock`, `thermostat`,
`shade`, `fan`, `button`, `runCommand`, `mode`, `setVariable` (alias: `variable`),
`log`, `notification`, `httpGet`, `httpPost`, `ping`, `volume`, `mute`, `chime`,
`siren`, `privateBoolean`, `runRule`, `cancelTimers`, `pauseRule`, `capture`,
`restore`, `refresh`, `poll`, `disableDevice`, `delay`, `delayPerMode`,
`cancelDelay`, `exitRule`, `comment`, `repeat`, `stopRepeat`, `repeatWhile`,
`waitExpression`, `waitEvents`, `ifThen`, `elseIf`, `else`, `endIf`, `fileWrite`,
`fileAppend`, `fileDelete`, `zwavePoll`.

### Optional modifiers (every action)

- `delay { hours, minutes, seconds, cancelable }` — sets `delayAct.<N>` +
  duration sub-fields
- `rawSettings { fieldName: value }` — escape hatch; use `@N` in field name as
  a placeholder for the action index

## _rmAddRequiredExpression

High-level orchestrated Required Expression creation. Replaces the 7+ manual
wizard calls (useST=true → navigate STPage → cond=a → rCapab/rDev/state per
condition → hasAll → oper → hasRule → done).

### Spec shape

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {"capability": "Switch", "deviceIds": [282], "state": "on"},
    {"capability": "Motion", "deviceIds": [284], "state": "active"}
  ],
  "operator": "AND"
}
```

### Per-condition fields

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `capability` | "Switch" / "Motion" / "Contact" / "Lock" / "Presence" / "Temperature" / "Humidity" / "Custom Attribute" / "Mode" / "Private Boolean" / etc. |
| `deviceIds` | Required for device-backed capabilities. Omit for Mode / Private Boolean / time-based. |
| `state` | Enum value ("on", "active", "open", "locked", "present", "true"/"false"). Omit for numeric comparator path. |
| `comparator` | For numeric capabilities: "<=", "=", ">", "<", ">=", etc. |
| `value` | Numeric threshold (paired with comparator). |
| `attribute` | For Custom Attribute capability: the attribute name. Required together with `comparator`. |
| `not` | `true` to invert this condition (NOT). |
| `rawSettings` | Escape hatch `{fieldName: value}` for unmapped fields. |

### Post-commit appSettings

- `useST=true`
- `rCapab_<N>`, `rDev_<N>`, `state_<N>` per condition
- `oper=<AND|OR|XOR>` when multi-condition (ephemeral -- may not persist after commit)

### STPage wizard internals (firmware 2.5.0.123)

Phase 1 -- condition building (one pass per condition):

1. `mainPage.useST=true` exposes the "Define Required Expression" href
2. STPage's `hrefParams` is `{unUsed: null}` -- placeholder only
3. STPage shows enum `cond` with options `a` (new condition) / `b` (sub-expression) / `c` (NOT)
4. After `cond=a`, schema reveals `rCapab_<N>` where N is the live cond counter
   (NOT necessarily 1 -- RM increments globally across the parent app)
5. After `rCapab_<N>=Switch`, `rDev_<N>` appears
6. After `rDev_<N>=[id]`, `state_<N>` appears
7. After `state_<N>=on`, `hasAll` button appears -- click to commit this slot
8. Repeat 3-7 for each condition, writing `oper=<AND|OR|XOR>` between conditions

Phase 2 -- sealing:

9. `hasRule` is a `submitOnChange` button (HTML value="button"). Writing it as a
   settings write to `/installedapp/update/json` SEALS the assembled formula.
   Using `/installedapp/btn` does NOT trigger the commit handler -- verified live:
   `/installedapp/btn` left conditions as "(unused)"; the settings-write path
   committed correctly.
10. After `hasRule`, the `doneST` button is a no-op. The proper exit is via the
    back-nav `_action_previous=Done`.

### predCapabs leak and the ghost ifThen workaround

After `hasRule` seals the expression, `atomicState.predCapabs` retains the RE's
condition context. A subsequent `addAction` for a plain (non-expression) action
would be wrapped in `IF(**Broken Condition**)`. `_rmClearPredCapabsViaGhostIfThen`
resets `predCapabs` by opening a `condActs/getIfThen` slot and immediately
canceling it -- the `getIfThen` initializer zeroes predCapabs; `actionCancel`
discards the slot before it bakes.

See `_rmClearPredCapabsViaGhostIfThen` source comment for the full probe-matrix
evidence.

## setVariable wire format

Live-verified wire format for `addAction(capability='setVariable')`.
Maps to `actType=modeActs`, `actSubType=getSetVariable`.

**Fields written to doActPage (action index N):**

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `xVarV.<N>` | hub variable name | Target variable (enum from hub variables list). Must be an existing hub variable name -- an unknown name is rejected before the hub write to prevent silent broken-action state. |
| `numOp.<N>` | `"number"`, `"add number"`, `"variable"`, `"device attribute"`, or `"variable math"` | The source-mode enum (full RM list below). `"number"` = constant; `"add number"` = add a constant to the current value; `"variable"` (full word) = copy-from-variable; `"device attribute"` = read a device attribute; `"variable math"` = structured math. Live-verified: the short form `"var"` is NOT accepted by RM 5.1 and causes the action to bake without a source. `numOp` is gated by `xVarV.<N>` -- it does not render until the target variable is written, so `xVarV` is always written first. `numOp` renders ONLY for a Number/Decimal target variable; for a String or Boolean target it is not rendered at all (live-verified; a String target gets `valStringOp.<N>` instead), so the addAction path rejects `value`/`fromDevice`/`math` into a non-numeric target up-front with `success=false` rather than writing a numOp that never lands. A `"variable"` copy also stores `valOffset.<N>`. |
| `valNumber.<N>` | numeric constant | Written when `numOp=number` or `numOp="add number"` (the `value` form's optional `numOp`). Only numeric constants are supported. A String target is copied with `sourceVariable`; Boolean/DateTime targets need `rawSettings`. |
| `valStringOp.<N>` | `"Copy variable"` (for `sourceVariable`) | A String target renders no `numOp`; its source picker is `valStringOp.<N>` (options include `Set string`, `Device attribute`, `Copy variable`, ...). The `sourceVariable` form writes `"Copy variable"`, which reveals the same `xVar3.<N>` source enum. Captured from the RM UI on fw 2.5.1.183: stored `valStringOp.1="Copy variable"`, `xVar3.1="AMGateA_Shared"`, rendered "Set GT1 to AMGateA_Shared". |
| `xVar3.<N>` | source variable name | Written when `numOp=variable` or, for a String target, `valStringOp="Copy variable"` (the `sourceVariable` form). Schema-gated: revealed by RM only after that selector is written. The field name `xVar3` is live-verified for RM 5.1; discovered from the live schema rather than hardcoded. Must be an existing hub variable name -- an unknown name is rejected before the hub write. |
| `valOffset.<N>` | `0` | Written after `xVar3.<N>` for a Number/Decimal `sourceVariable` copy. RM adds it to the source value when the rule runs, and the RM UI stores `0` by default. Without it the action saves and renders normally, but running it throws `Ambiguous method overloading for method java.lang.Long#plus`, the target is not set and the rest of the rule's actions are skipped. Captured from the RM UI on fw 2.5.1.183: `numOp.1="variable"`, `xVar3.1="zzCopySrc"`, `valOffset.1=0`. Not rendered for a String copy. |
| `customDev.<N>` | source device id | Written when `numOp="device attribute"` (the `fromDevice` form). `capability.*` single-device picker (`multiple=false`), stored as an id->label map. Schema-gated: revealed after `numOp="device attribute"`. RM's picker spans ALL hub devices. |
| `tCustomAttr.<N>` | source attribute name | Written after `customDev.<N>` (the `fromDevice` form). Enum FILTERED to the selected device's live attributes; revealed only after the device is written. An attribute outside the filtered enum is rejected with the available list. |
| `xVar3.<N>` / `valConst.<N>` | first math operand | Written when `numOp="variable math"` (the `math` form). The first operand: a hub variable name (`xVar3.<N>`), or the sentinel `"(constant)"` in `xVar3.<N>` which reveals `valConst.<N>` for a literal number. Revealed after `numOp="variable math"`. A variable-name operand is existence-validated against the hub variable list before the write (an unknown name is rejected up-front); the chosen `xVar3` option (the variable name or the `(constant)` sentinel) is also validated against the field's revealed enum before writing. |
| `valMathOp.<N>` | operator | Written when `numOp="variable math"`. Binary: `+ - * / %`; unary: `negate absolute round random sqrt sin cos tan asin acos atan log toRadians toDegrees`. A binary operator reveals the second operand; a unary operator takes no second operand. The operator is validated against the field's revealed enum before writing. |
| `xVar4.<N>` / `valConst2.<N>` | second math operand | Written for BINARY operators only. Revealed after the binary `valMathOp.<N>` is written. Same shape as the first operand: a variable name in `xVar4.<N>`, or `"(constant)"` revealing `valConst2.<N>`. A variable-name operand is existence-validated against the hub variable list before the write; the chosen `xVar4` option is also validated against the field's revealed enum. |

`value`, `sourceVariable`, `fromDevice`, and `math` are mutually exclusive; exactly
one source mode is required. The `value` path writes `numOp=number` (or `"add number"`) +
`valNumber` -- the hub's wire format does not expose separate type-specific constant
slots for string/boolean/datetime at this subtype. Use `sourceVariable` to copy into a
Number, Decimal or String target, or `rawSettings` to supply advanced wire fields directly.
The restriction is on the target; the source is validated separately against the revealed enum.
A `sourceVariable` copy into a Boolean or DateTime target is refused before any action row is
written: their copy picker has not been mapped yet. (Live: `numOp` is not rendered for a Boolean
target, so writing it is rejected `not_in_schema`.)

**`numOp` enum and "add number":** for a Number hub/local variable RM offers exactly `number`,
`add number`, `sensor value`, `variable`, `variable math`, `current time`, `current hour`,
`current minute`, `epoch time`, `device attribute`, `string`, `string length`, `Rule Function`,
`time difference`. `"add number"` reveals the same single `valNumber.<N>` slot as `"number"` (UI
label "Number to add to <var>"), and `numOp.<N>="add number"` + `valNumber.<N>=<n>` renders
"Add <n> to <var>" (captured live, fw 2.5.1.181 / RM 5.1.8). The `value` form accepts an optional
`numOp` of `number` (default) or `add number`; any other `numOp`, or `numOp` without `value`, is
refused before any write.

**Reveal order (every mode writes `xVarV.<N>` first, then its selector. The selector is `numOp.<N>`, except for a `sourceVariable` copy into a String target, which writes `valStringOp.<N>`; `value`, `fromDevice` and `math` are refused for a String target):**
- `sourceVariable`, Number/Decimal target: `numOp="variable"` -> reveals `xVar3.<N>` -> write the source name -> write `valOffset.<N>=0`.
- `sourceVariable`, String target: `valStringOp.<N>="Copy variable"` -> reveals `xVar3.<N>` -> write the source name. `numOp.<N>` is never rendered for a String target, so writing it fails `not_in_schema`.
- `fromDevice`: `numOp="device attribute"` -> reveals `customDev.<N>`; write device -> reveals `tCustomAttr.<N>` (filtered) -> write attribute.
- `math`: `numOp="variable math"` -> reveals `xVar3.<N>` + `valMathOp.<N>`; a `(constant)` first operand reveals `valConst.<N>`; a binary operator reveals `xVar4.<N>`; a `(constant)` second operand reveals `valConst2.<N>`. Unary operators stop after the operator write.

**Orphan-field note:** RM does NOT auto-clean mode-specific keys when `numOp` changes
(e.g. `customDev.<N>` lingers after switching to `variable math`). The addAction path
builds each action fresh, so this is harmless here; a future setVariable-EDIT path must
clear stale mode keys. Leftover hidden keys under a working action are normal RM behavior:
RM's own UI keeps them when the variable type is switched mid-form.

A refused add has already persisted `actType`/`actSubType` plus whatever fields landed before the
refusal, and leaves the editor open on `actNdx=N` (the next add reopens row N pre-filled). So any
refusal after `actType.<N>` is written attempts to cancel doActPage's editor with `actionCancel`
(`cancelAct.<N>` is only the delay toggle). When cleanup confirms row removal, it consumes the
index -- the next action gets N+1; blank `actType`/`actSubType` (and `tCustomAttr`) keys may
remain. If removal cannot be confirmed, the response includes `wizardStuck`; action N's stale
fields may remain and reopen on the next add. Close the editor first with
`hub_set_rule(button='actionCancel', pageName='doActPage', confirm=true)` (removeAction is refused
while the editor holds `state.editAct`), verify with `hub_get_app_config`, then remove any
surviving row with `hub_set_rule(removeAction:{index:N}, confirm:true)` or restore the pre-write
backup using `hub_restore_backup(scope='source', backupKey='<response.backup.backupKey>', confirm=true)`.

## runCommand extra parameters -- moreParams / P-discovery wire sequence

Live-verified wire format for `addAction(capability='runCommand', parameters=[...])`.
P is RM-assigned (starts at 2, never computed by the caller).

**Per-parameter sequence (repeat for each parameter):**

1. Click the `moreParams` button (`_rmClickAppButton`). RM allocates the next
   parameter slot and reveals `cpType<P>.<N>` in the doActPage schema.

2. Re-introspect doActPage. Find the newly-revealed `cpType<P>.<N>` field by
   diffing against the pre-click schema snapshot. P is extracted from the field
   name (e.g. `cpType2.1` -> P=2). This P-discovery step is mandatory -- P is
   never 1 and is never derivable from parameter index.

3. Write `cpType<P>.<N> = type` (lowercase: `number`, `decimal`, `string`).
   This reveals `uVar<P>.<N>` (bool toggle) and `cpVal<P>.<N>` (literal text
   input) in the schema.

4a. **Literal value path**: write `cpVal<P>.<N> = value`. Done.

4b. **Variable-sourced path**: write `uVar<P>.<N> = "true"`. Re-introspect.
    `xVar<P>.<N>` (an enum of live hub variable names) appears; `cpVal<P>.<N>`
    disappears. If `xVar<P>.<N>` is NOT revealed after the uVar write (firmware
    gap, unsupported command), fail loud with `IllegalArgumentException` -- a silent
    fall-through would produce a rule that renders broken with no caller-visible
    error. Validate the target variable name is present in the enum options; fail
    loud with the available list if not. Write `xVar<P>.<N> = variableName`.

**Persisted state (live-verified, firmware 2.5.0.123):**

- Literal param: `cpType<P>.N = type`, `cpVal<P>.N = value`
- Variable param: `cpType<P>.N = type`, `uVar<P>.N = "true"`, `xVar<P>.N = varName`

`cpVar` does NOT exist in the RM 5.1 schema. Writing it is silently ignored.

Two parameter shapes exist because RM 5.1 exposes separate literal (`cpVal<P>`) and
variable (`uVar<P>`+`xVar<P>`) reveal paths that cannot be unified into a single write
sequence -- the hub shows or hides `cpVal<P>` vs `xVar<P>` based on the current value
of `uVar<P>`, so they are mutually exclusive at the schema level.

**moreParams_no_reveal (consumer-actionable):**

If the `moreParams` button click does not reveal a new `cpType<P>.<N>` field in the
re-introspected schema, the parameter cannot be wired. The implementation records the
skipped parameter in `settingsSkipped` with `reason='moreParams_no_reveal'` and sets
`partial=true` on the action result rather than silently dropping the parameter. Callers
should inspect `settingsSkipped` for entries with this reason and consult `repairHints`
for next steps. Common causes: firmware version does not support parameters for this
command, or the command name is invalid and RM did not allocate a slot.
